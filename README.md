## General Info
In this project, I created a banking system using Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) techniques. In my bank, I created entities for customers, employees and accounts. Each of these entities have distinct properties. For example, customer and employee entities include first name, last name, address, email, PIN, salary and other properties. While accounts entity includes account type, account number, balance, deposit and withdrawal properties.

Customer, employee and account information is stored using JSON files.

```core.py``` is the driver consisting of menu options
